    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This notebook demonstrates how to collect real-time game data using our custom `DataCollector` class. It fetches data from Steam (player counts, details), Twitch (viewership), and external sources like Google Trends, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:** This automated collection process provides fresh, multi-faceted data crucial for building our time series dataset and ultimately, the game popularity prediction model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to Expect:** After running this notebook, you will:\n",
    "1. Successfully collect current data from multiple APIs.\n",
    "2. Save the combined data in a structured format (compressed CSV).\n",
    "3. Understand the enhanced data collection workflow.\n",
    "4. Have the first data point for building a historical dataset."

If you run this frequently or with many games, you might hit these limits, resulting in `403` (Quota Exceeded) or `429` (Too Many Requests) errors.
